  <h1>Prime Number Generator Coding Exercise</h1>
  <h2>Overview:</h2>
  <p>Your task is to use test driven development to implement a prime number generator that
    returns an ordered list of all prime numbers in a given range (inclusive of the endpoints).
    You must implement the interface specified below. You may also create any other
    methods, interfaces and/or classes that you deem necessary to complete the project.
    You should also develop a small main program to drive your generator and to allow the
    user to specify the prime number range via the command line. To successfully
    complete the exercise, all unit tests must pass as well as provide 100% code coverage.
    Notes:
    • The code should handle inverse ranges such that 1-10 and 10-1 are equivalent.
    • Ensure that you run a test against the range 7900 and 7920 (valid primes are 7901,
    7907, 7919).

  <h4>Definition (from wikipedia):</h4>
  <p>
    In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"><u>mathematics</u></a>
    , a prime number (or a prime) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number">
    <u>natural number</u></a>
    which has exactly
    two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself. The first twenty-six prime numbers are:
    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89,
    97, 101
